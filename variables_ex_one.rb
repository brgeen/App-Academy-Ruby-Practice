# 1. Declare a variable named `firstName` and assign it your first name as a string:
first_name = "Brooks"

# 2. Declare a variable named `lastName` and assign it your last name as a string:

last_name = "Geenen"
# 3. Declare a variable named `fullName` and assign it the concatenation of
# your `firstName` and `lastName`. Be sure to put a space between your
# first and last names:

full_name = last_name + ", " + first_name
# 4. print out the `fullName` variable

puts full_name
